# Detect_faces
This is a basic program to detect faces in an image. I made this project as an introduction to OpenCV library.
If you download this code, you can use any image but make sure you must replace the name of the image with the 
image name in the code and the image must be present in the same directory.

# this code can be modified for applying on multiple images in a loop.
# Using glob to find all the images in the path

Download OpenCV module if it is not installed already.
# Terminal: pip3 install opencv-python ( Windows )
